      can be used at any bank branch.

      SWIFT code of the bank from which the money is to be received;
      
      full name of the payee (natural person) or full name of a legal entity;
      
      16-digit recipient's account number (IBAN format);
      
      the name of the bank branch where the money is received;
      
      requisites of intermediary banking institutions.

      Choose major financial institutions as sending and receiving banks - in this case, the transaction can take only a few hours.
